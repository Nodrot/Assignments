## Overview
these projects were built using html and css.
Week 3 consist of a portfolio website having an about-me section, resume section, services section, a contact page and a project page.
week 4 consist of a 3-column card I created using flex box. The flexbox page is also linked to a grid template page designed using grid latout.

## my process
-I first had to search for designs online to have a guide to what i'm to create.
-I scrutinized this designs to know what layout i'm to adopt, tags and elements.
-After figuring out the layout etc., I proceeded to creating my codes
